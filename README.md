# advent-of-code-2018

Advent of Code is a christmas calendar for programmers. Every year, from the 1st of December until the 24th, every day a new riddle is released on https://adventofcode.com. Programmers compete to be the fastest to solve the riddle and add their name to the leaderboard. Afterwards solutions are being discussed in the forum, often represented in a multitude of programing languages.

This is my take on the 2018 AOC written in PHP 7.
